Nanotechnology being dedicated to the study of a world so small, the realm of atoms and nanostructures, can be used to reproduce things like diamonds, which in their original form take millions of years to form. All the measurements are done in namo-meters.A nanometer(nm) is one-billionth of a meter, smaller than the wavelength of visible light and a hundred-thousandth the width of a human hair [source: Berkeley Lab].

In general, you can think of  Nanotechnology as something dealing with anything measuring between 1 and 100 nm. Larger than that is the microscale, and smaller than that is the atomic scale.
